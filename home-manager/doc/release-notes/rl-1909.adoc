=== State Version Changes

The state version in this release includes the changes below. These
changes are only active if the `home.stateVersion` option is set to
"19.09" or later.

* The <<opt-programs.firefox.package>> option now expects a wrapped
  Firefox package and defaults to `pkgs.firefox`.

* The options <<opt-home.keyboard.layout>> and
  <<opt-home.keyboard.variant>> now default to `null`, which indicates
  that the system value should be used.
