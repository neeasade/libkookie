This repository contains all my commonly shared configuation files,
using `home-manager` as a configuration tool.
This uses `nix`.

The base configuration can be found in `home.nix`,
and all components are being handled by their own files.
The actual configurations are then located in folders,
so that they're easier to index and sort.
