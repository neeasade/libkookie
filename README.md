# Kookie's computer thingamajiggies

These are all my commonly shared configuration files.
Some modifications might depend on [kookiepkgs],
my personal `nix` package repository.

[kookiepkgs]: https://github.com/spacekookie/kookiepkgs

The configurations are rolled out with [`home-manager`].

Most directories will have a `default.nix` file that configures things.
The exception being `home.nix` which contains all package modifications,
so that they're all neatly in one place :)
