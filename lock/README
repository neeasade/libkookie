whatthecommit lock
==================

I use i3-lock which can display a message while the screen is locked. This is everything you need to do the same on your system. It consists of three parts

1) Simple bash script
2) Simple ruby script that sources quotes
3) Quotes collection

Feel free to replace my quotes collection which is slightly curated to remove duplicates
